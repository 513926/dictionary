List of the Most Common English Words
=====================================

The Unix dictionary contains far too many rediculous words that even Google has
trouble explaining, such as `zuurveldt`, `cholecystenterorrhaphy` and `nonly`:

    $ cat /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l
    235886

Even the `enable1.txt` dictionary used by Words with Friends contains more
words than most English speaking adults know:

    $ cat enable1.txt | wc -l
    172819


According to an article[1] entitled "The words in the mental cupboard",

> "An ordinary person, one who has not been to university say, would know about 35,000 quite easily."

So, what are those 35,000 words?
