List of the Most Common English Words
=====================================

The Unix dictionary contains far too many ridiculous words that even Google has
trouble explaining, such as `zuurveldt`, `cholecystenterorrhaphy` and `nonly`:

    $ cat /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l
    235886

Even the `enable1.txt` dictionary used by Words with Friends(r)[1] contains
more words than any English speaking adult would reasonably be familiar with:

    $ cat enable1.txt | wc -l
    172819

According to an article[2] entitled 'The words in the mental cupboard'
published by the BBC, "An ordinary person, one who has not been to university
say, would know about 35,000 quite easily."
